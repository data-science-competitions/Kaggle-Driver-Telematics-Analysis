# AXA-Driver-Telematics-Analysis

This project aim to design a solution to the
[AXA Driver Telematics challenge][AXA] on Kaggle.
 
The repository includes code of my solution with additional code
implementing ideas which where release after the competition had ended. 

## Code overview:

* scripts/sample_the_dataset.m - create _positive_ and _negative_ data sets
  for local evaluation purposes. Let you define and import:
    * The driver of interests trips batch (_positive data set_)
    * The number of arbitrary irrelevant trips (_negative data set_)
